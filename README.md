#FrontMan Challenge

Week 6 at Makers Academy

###The Challenge

Recreate the front-end of the twitter feed page using only HTML, CSS and Javascript. No back-end. 

###Method

I made continuous comparisons with the CSS behind Twitter's homepage. I did not
use a CSS Framework, however, when I pick up this challenge again I intend to
use Foundation for the Grid system.

###Improvements

This weekend challenge was unfortunately set on a very busy weekend for me
personally. As such it is unfinished.
